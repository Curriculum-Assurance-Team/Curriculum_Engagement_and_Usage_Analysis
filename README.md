## **Project Description:**
In preparation for the upcoming board meeting on Thursday afternoon, we are conducting an analysis of our educational curriculum's usage patterns and identifying any potential anomalies or concerns. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the engagement levels of different cohorts with our curriculum, detect any suspicious activities, and uncover trends related to post-graduation knowledge retention. By addressing the specific questions provided, we aim to equip you with comprehensive information to discuss and make informed decisions during the board meeting.

## **Project Goals:**
1. **Traffic Analysis and Popular Lessons:** Identify the lesson that consistently attracts the highest traffic across cohorts for each program. This analysis will provide insights into which topics are resonating well with our students.

2. **Cohort-Specific Engagement:** Determine if any particular cohort exhibits significantly different behavior in terms of lesson engagement compared to others. Detect instances where certain cohorts appear to show heightened or decreased interest in specific lessons.

3. **Low Engagement Students:** Identify and profile students who exhibit minimal engagement with the curriculum despite being active. Provide information on these students' characteristics and engagement patterns.

4. **Anomaly Detection and Suspicious Activity:** Investigate and report any suspicious activities, unauthorized access, or web scraping attempts in the curriculum. Identify potential anomalous IP addresses and user/machine activities.

5. **Cross-Curriculum Access:** Examine whether the access to both the web development and data science curricula was disabled as intended in 2019. Determine if there is evidence of the transition's timing and completion.

6. **Post-Graduation Knowledge Retention:** Analyze which topics and lessons our graduates continue to reference in their jobs after completing each program. This insight will highlight the curriculum's lasting impact on their careers.

7. **Underutilized Lessons:** Identify the lessons that are accessed the least by our students. This information will help us understand which areas might need improvement or additional attention.

8. **Unanticipated Insights:** In addition to the specified questions, proactively uncover any other significant findings, trends, or insights that could be valuable for decision-making.

## **Initial Questions**
1. Identify the lesson that consistently garners the highest traffic across cohorts within each program?
2. Is there a particular cohort that has demonstrated significantly higher engagement with a specific lesson than other cohorts, warranting further investigation?
3. Identify instances of active students who exhibit minimal interaction with the curriculum? If so,provide insights into these students' behavior and engagement patterns?
4. Detect any potentially unauthorized access or suspicious activities, including unusual access patterns or indications of web scraping? Are there any indications of suspicious IP addresses?
5. Has the access for students and alumni to both curriculums (web development to data science, data science to web development) been disabled as intended at some point in 2019? Confirm if this change was implemented and if so, when?
6. Outline the topics that graduates continue to reference beyond their graduation and into their professional roles for both programs?
7. Which lessons have recorded the lowest levels of access?
8. Is there any additional information or insights that you believe would be pertinent for me to be aware of?

## **Instructions to Reproduce the Final Project Notebook**
To successfully run/reproduce the final project notebook, please follow these steps:

- Read this README.md document to familiarize yourself with the project details and key findings.
- Before proceeding, ensure that you have the necessary database credentials. Get data set from csv  Create .gitignore for privacy if necessary
- Clone the classification_project repository from my GitHub or download the following files: wrange.py and final_report.ipynb. -  - You can find these files in the project repository.
- Open the final_report.ipynb notebook in your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment or any compatible Python environment.
- Ensure that all necessary libraries or dependent programs are installed (e.g IO String). You may need to install additional packages if they are not already present in your environment.
- Run the final_report.ipynb notebook to execute the project code and generate the results. By following these instructions, you will be able to reproduce the analysis and review the project's final report. Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and conclusions presented in the notebook.

**Approach:**
To achieve these goals, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis of our curriculum data, including user engagement logs, access timestamps, IP addresses, and cohort information. We will utilize data analysis techniques, such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and anomaly detection, to answer the specified questions and identify any patterns or anomalies. The results will be presented in a clear and concise manner, with visualizations and explanations to facilitate understanding.


## **Key Findings**
The outcome of this project will be a detailed in an report addressing each of the provided questions, along with any additional insights we uncover during our analysis. The report will provide you with the necessary information to discuss curriculum engagement, anomalies, and post-graduation trends during the upcoming board meeting, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.

Please feel free to provide any additional guidance or clarification, and we will ensure that our analysis aligns with your expectations and needs.
